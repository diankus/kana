        <p>After a second year of doing a virtual draft, the nhl is planning to go back to doing a live event and will be held in montreal next year. Follow along pick by pick. While we always release our very early list for the following year’s draft in the previous drafts edition of our nhl draft black book, the first release of the season arrives in late september or october.</p>
