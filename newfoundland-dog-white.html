    <p>The newfoundland served as a helpful assistant by pulling heavy fishing nets or other equipment and rescuing sailors who had fallen overboard. These dogs are always eager and willing to please and are a great choice for people with families, as the newfoundland seems to have a real affinity for children and likes nothing better than to play interactive games with them. They are physically made for tasks like that with their webbed paws, huge lung capacity, and oily double coat that protects them from icy waters. The newfoundland is water dog, frequently used for retrieval of items and even people. The latter “landseer” newfoundland was only identified in 1779.</p>
